Privacy Policy version 1.0 for the human pose detection iOS app
The human pose detection iOS app does not collect any user data of any kind. The app does not access the Internet at all.

It just allows the user to take pictures of themself to generate a "skeleton" outline.

If you wish to verify this for yourself, see the source code at https://github.com/coleschaffer/HumanPoseDetection
